# PF2e Journal Toolkit

This module was made possible by the FoundryVTT team, who created the original working versions of this module for Kingmaker.

The tool is set up for my friend who is a non-verbal GM, allowing them to prepare speeches and descriptions.

NOTE: This overrides all CSS of journals, so it's not intended to be an elegant solution. I will work to refine that over time.
